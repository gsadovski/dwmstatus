This is a fork of suckless dwmstatus based on another fork by Wojtek242. It can display wifi info such as SSID, signal strengh, upload and download speed, cpu, ram, swap, temperature, battery, disk usage, date and time. Optionally, I use unicode (UTF-8) characters as symbols for displaying these infos. Screenshots below.

CONFIG
______

It is necessary to alter some configs within dwmstatus.c so it will correctly pick your hardware's info. Check all #define variable, specially WIFICARD, WIREDCARD, BATT-NOW, BATT-FULL, etc... and make the necessary modification for it to get it right.

INSTALL
______

Git clone this repo. cd into it. run
$make
$sudo make install
You should have now a working bin bash.
